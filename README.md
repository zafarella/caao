#The CAAO

Stands for Context-aware organizer. The main idea of the project is creation 
of organizer which is context-aware [Mark Weiser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Weiser).

I have utilized OSGi as a server side to extend server functionality by 
contributing module and android as mobile client or the front-end. Web front-end 
is planned to be implemented using Vaadin as another plugable bundle for OSGi (in progress).

The actual data from sensors collected via SOS [(Sensor Observation Service)](http://52north.org/communities/sensorweb/sos/index.html). 
It supports variety of sensors not only spatial.


## Architecture in brief
Server side is requires Java > 1.6 and the client side is android application.
