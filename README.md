#The CAAO
====
Stands for Context-aware orginizer. The main idea of the project is creation of orginizer wich is context-aware [(Mark Weiser)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Weiser).
I have tried to utilize OSGi as a server side and android as mobile part.

# Requires
====
### For server side
* JDK 1.6 or greater
* Eclipse
  * [Knopflerfish eclipse plug-in](http://www.knopflerfish.org/eclipse_plugin.html)
  * Apache Ant - optional
  * JUnit 3
  * maven

====
##For mobile part
* Android SDK
 * 
====
## Using maven
## IDE
## IDEA
* Just import maven project, the rest should work. Idea has a bug on Linux - it does not reads the env variables -- workaround: 
```bash
bash -l /opt/idea/bin/idea.sh
```
## Eclipse
