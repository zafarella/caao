#The CAAO
====
Stands for Context-aware orginizer. The main idea of the project is creation of orginizer wich is context-aware [(Mark Weiser)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Weiser).
I have tried to utilize OSGi as a server side and android as mobile part.

# Requires
====
## Back-end
* JDK 1.6 or greater
* Eclipse
  * [Knopflerfish eclipse plug-in](http://www.knopflerfish.org/eclipse_plugin.html)
  * Apache Ant - optional
  * JUnit 3
  * maven

====
## Front-end
  * Android SDK

====
### Using maven
* see the release.sh

## IDE
#### IDEA
* Just import maven project, the rest should work. Idea has a bug on Linux - it does not reads the env variables -- workaround: 
```bash
bash -l /opt/idea/bin/idea.sh
```

#### Eclipse
You will need:
* Maven plugin
* git client (if wanna commit for eclipse)
